### Fonts

We chosed Shantell Sans as our main font, because it matches the goal of our project: Building an available, free, accessible and fun tool.

However, this font is not fitted for writing math, and given that this program will depend on LaTeX generation tools, Shantell Sans will only be used for specific cases, like in GUI-programs and while promoting our products.
